3. **Drag and Drop Puzzle**: Implement a drag-and-drop puzzle game where users can rearrange pieces to form an image, with success indicated by a message.

4. //**Dynamic Form Validation**: Create a form with multiple input fields and validate them dynamically as the user types, providing feedback on the validity of each field.

5. **Image Carousel with Controls**: Build an image carousel that allows users to navigate through images using both arrow buttons and keyboard arrow keys.

6. **Accordion Menu**: Design an accordion-style menu where clicking on one item expands it while collapsing any previously expanded items.

7. **Tooltip Generator**: Develop a script that dynamically generates tooltips when hovering over specific elements, with customizable content and styles.

8. **Countdown Timer**: Create a countdown timer that starts when a button is clicked and displays the remaining time, updating every second until reaching zero.

9. **Resizable Textarea**: Implement a resizable textarea element that expands vertically as the user types, with a maximum height limit and a scrollbar when needed.

10. **Modal Popup with Animation**: Design a modal popup window that appears with a smooth animation when triggered by a button click, and closes when clicking outside the modal or pressing the escape key.

Each of these programs involves handling different DOM events such as mouse events, keyboard events, form events, and more, providing a variety of challenges for JavaScript developers.
